# Card-Counter

Takes a hand from a game of 5-card cribbage in the form NumberSuit, ```for example 5D is 5 of diamonds, AS is ace of spades``` and returns the resulting score for the hand.

Hands are entered in the form Hand Cut Card, ``` for example 5D AS KS QH 9C where the first four are your hand and the last one is the cut card```
